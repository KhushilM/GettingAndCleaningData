Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project
======================

By Khushil Modi

The submission of this project involves a couple of things, so please read this readme file to understand how to interpret my results.

On the GitHub link you have just opened there are 3 files - this one, run_analysis.R and CodeBook.md.

"Run_anaysis.R" 
----
This is the raw script which performs the following instructions:

"You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

The txt version of this file has been submitted.

"CodeBook.md"
----
This is 'a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data'. Essentially, it will explain all the steps in run_analysis.R

The Codebook will comment on relevant lines within the script which should be compared accordingly.

Enjoy!!
